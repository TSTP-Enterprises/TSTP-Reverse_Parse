# TSTP-Reverse_Parse
 
A tool that allows you to parse all the files in a folder into a single text area that you can save to your clipboard or save to a file.  Files are separated by markers to tell where the file starts and ends.  Perfect for sending a folder full of HTML/CSS/JS/PHP or even all of your python files.
